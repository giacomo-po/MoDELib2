The HTML subfolder corresponds to the remote repository:
https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model.bitbucket.org

In order to update the documentation do the following:

1) Delete the folder HTML

2) Clone the remote repository into the local HTML folder
hg clone https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model.bitbucket.org ./HTML

3) Empty the HTML folder

4) Run  oxygen using the following doxyfile
MODEL/docs/doxygen/doxyfile 
(which has ../../ as source directory and ../HTML as destination directory)

4) move into the HTML and use hg
cd HTML
hg addremove
hg commit -m 'some comment'
hg push


Note that MODEL/.hgignore does not track Model/docs/HTML, which is a repository itself.
