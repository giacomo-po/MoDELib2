  year={2009},
  abstract={An accurate description of the thermoelastic response of solids is central to classical simulations of compression- and deformation-induced condensed matter phenomena. To achieve the correct thermoelastic description in classical simulations, a new approach is presented for determining interatomic potentials. In this two-step approach, values of atomic volume and the second- and third-order elastic constants measured at room temperature are extrapolated to T = 0 K using classical thermo-mechanical relations that are thermodynamically consistent. Next, the interatomic potentials are fitted to these T = 0 K pseudo-values. This two-step approach avoids the low-temperature quantum regime, providing consistency with the assumptions of classical simulations and enabling the correct thermoelastic response to be recovered in simulations at room temperature and higher. As an example of our approach, an EAM potential was developed for aluminum, providing significantly better agreement with thermoelastic data compared with previous EAM potentials. The approach presented here is quite general and can be used for other potential types as well, the key restriction being the inapplicability of classical atomistic simulations when quantum effects are important.}

  abstract={A new analytic bond-order potential for iron is presented that has been fitted to experimental data and results from first-principles calculations. The angular-dependent functional form allows a proper description of a large variety of bulk, surface and defect properties, including the Bain path, phonon dispersions, defect diffusivities and defect formation energies. By calculating Gibbs free energies of body-centred cubic (bcc) and face-centred cubic (fcc) iron as a function of temperature, we show that this potential is able to reproduce the transitions from α-iron to γ-iron and δ-iron before the melting point. The results are compared to four widely used embedded-atom-method potentials for iron.}

@article{sunyk2003,
abstract = {Continuum-atomistic modelling denotes a mixed approach combining the usual framework of continuum mechanics with atomistic features like e.g. interaction or rather pair potentials. Thereby, the kinematics are typically characterized by the so-called Cauchy-Born rule representing atomic distance vectors in the spatial configuration as an affine mapping of the atomic distance vectors in the material configuration in terms of the local deformation gradient. The application of the Cauchy-Born rule requires sufficiently homogeneous deformations of the underlying crystal. The model is no more valid if the deformation becomes inhomogeneous. Nevertheless the development of microstructures with inhomogeneous deformation is inevitable. In the present work, the Cauchy-Born rule is thus extended to capture inhomogeneous deformations by the incorporation of the second-order deformation gradient. The higher-order equilibrium equation as well as the appropriate boundary conditions are presented for the case of finite deformations. The constitutive law for the Piola-Kirchhoff stress and the additional higher-order stress are represented for the simplified case of pair potential-based energy density functions. Finally, a deformation inhomogeneity measure is introduced and studied for a particular non-homogeneous simple-shear like deformation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
